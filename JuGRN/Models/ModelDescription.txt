To estimate optimal models properly, first run include("AdjDriver.jl") from inside the model_x folder, 
then close and reopen julia and run include("estimate_model_parameters_driver.jl")

*Need to close is a bug. Sometimes will run infinitely if AdjDriver and estimate_model_parameters_driver are run in same session

To rank the models, run include("rank_models.jl") from Model directory

model_7 was unable to run properly with new conditions, but had poor results in earlier tests

AdjSimulation code in the estimate_model_parameters_driver is commented out for speed

Problem 2 Model data is included in the Prob2 folder

The sensitivity data for problem 2 is generated via include("AdjDriver.jl")
from inside the Prob2 folder

Problem 3 Model data is included in the Models Folder

All error optimization is performed with the include("estimate_model_parameters_driver.jl")
from inside the model_X directory

Inputs to the code generation tools can be found in Model_Inputs folder

Models 1-5 induce gene_1, models 6-7 induce gene_2

Models 4,7 have 18 params
Models 1,3,5,6 have 21 params
Model 2 has 24 params
